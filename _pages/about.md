I am a Ph.D. student at [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/), Pittsburgh, PA.

**Research Interests**\
My research interests are Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Computer Vision. I am interested in desiging compact neural architectures using recent automated Machine Learning (auto ML) approaches: Evolutionary algorithm, Reinforcement Learning. 

I obtained my master's degree from CMU, advised by Prof.[Marios Savvides](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/savvides-marios.html). Prior to that, I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [University of Science, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam](https://en.hcmus.edu.vn/), advised by Prof.[Triet Minh Tran](https://www.fit.hcmus.edu.vn/~tmtriet/) and Dr. Son Thai Tran.

I worked as a Software Engineer and ML/AI Research Engineer at Misfit/[Fossil group](https://www.fossil.com/en-us/), a wearable devices company for 3 years.

I then worked as a ML/AI Research Engineer at [Axon Enterprise](https://www.axon.com/), a company working on on-body camera for polices worldwide.

Currently, along with my PhD program at CMU, I worked at [Cylab](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/) as a research assistant. 

I served as a reviewer of IEEE Access, ICLR 2019, and ICLR 2020.
