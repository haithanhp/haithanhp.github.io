I am a Ph.D. student at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cmu.edu/">CMU</a>, Pittsburgh, PA.

**Research Interests**\
My research interests are Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Computer Vision. I am interested in desiging compact neural architectures using recent automated Machine Learning (auto ML) approaches: Evolutionary algorithm, Reinforcement Learning. 

I obtained my master's degree from CMU, advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/savvides-marios.html">Marios Savvides</a>. Prior to that, I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at <a target="_blank" href="https://en.hcmus.edu.vn/">University of Science, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam</a>, advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fit.hcmus.edu.vn/~tmtriet/">Triet Minh Tran</a> and Son Thai Tran.

I worked as a Software Engineer and ML/AI Research Engineer at Misfit/<a target="_blank" href="https://www.fossil.com/en-us/">Fossil group</a>, a wearable devices company for 3 years.

I then worked as a ML/AI Research Engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.axon.com/">Axon Enterprise</a>, a company working on on-body camera for polices worldwide.

Currently, along with my PhD program at CMU, I worked at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/">Cylab</a> as a research assistant. 

I served as a reviewer of IEEE Access, ICLR 2019, and ICLR 2020.
